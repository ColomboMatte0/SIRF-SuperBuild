We provide a Virtual Machine (currently using [VirtualBox](https://www.virtualbox.org)) to make it easier to get going with our software.

This directory contains files with information on how to install and use this VM. You can download the VM itself from [Zenodo](https://zenodo.org/doi/10.5281/zenodo.3228198). (This link should always point to the most recent version. You can download older versions from there.)
